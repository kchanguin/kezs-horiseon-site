# What I learned

I learned how to utilize HTML and CSS to the fullest. Removing Divs and creating them into sections helps make CSS easier to apply in my opinion. I prefer semantic style. The box model is beneficial to memorize since it helps map out where exactly you'd like to place certain content and how big or small you want them to be.
